# Discord custom CSS : JS manager

The command.js file is where you can change the internal CSS from discord using native JS.
You also have the raw Discord CSS in raw.css.

## How to use

3 steps :

1) Make the changes you want in command.js then copy the whole file

2) Open Discord and press `CTRL + Maj + i` to open the console (same as in any chronium-based browser)

*you'll see a warning, they are right ! Never trust anyone, first know what you're doing before pasting anything !*

3) Paste the file you copied and press ENTER. You can know close the console and enjoy your new Discord design

**Every time Discord reloads, you should redo the copy-pasting to have your customized CSS**
